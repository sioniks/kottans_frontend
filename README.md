## JavaScript Basics - done

it was really hard for me. The first part of this task is all ok. But the second gave me several nights without sleep. Do I not understand something, but the task was not from the basic level. Every task had to be read for several hours.
P.S. Thank you Sorax...

## Document Object Model - done

JS algorithms were difficult for me. A lot of information has to be read and mastered.

Working with the house is a little easier - after studying the material from the lesson.

I hope in the future will be easier.
